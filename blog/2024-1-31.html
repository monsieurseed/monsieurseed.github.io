        <h1>Again, anxiety</h1>
        <p>If there is one word that can describe my high school life, that would be anxiety. This thought came back to me when I saw the post by ICC official, a source that brought me the most anxiety, that three ICC students were chosen for the national team to participate in the ISEF. Two of whom I know. This is peer pressure, one of the most terrifying pressures of all kinds. Why? It seems like at the last second you were joking around with your peer and the next moment they achieved something great and left you far behind. One of the two students I know not only got into the national team for this event but also got into the national team for IYPT, a renowned international physics tournament, and got a silver medal in the Yau award. The other advanced to the final round of the national talents program. What's cruel is that they are not far away, like legends, but people who I assume I know quite well. I can’t help but imagine the scene of them being accepted into Ivies or MIT. When I came across this thought, I knew, I was polluted by one of the seven deadly sins, envy. </p>
        <p>Insightful reflections always occur when terrible feelings grow within you. Same this time. I realized that being a late starter, no matter how hard I work in competitions, I possess no advantages. My advantages are, internally, I have an interest in both computation and passion in everyday life, externally, I know experts in this field that are willing to lead my way. Therefore, I need to stick to my track of combining computation and sociology. This is not easy, given that our school is the most renowned for STEM competitions and people who have won STEM medals gain a great amount of recognition from other people and also universities. I am also one of them. Do I want to be like them? For sure! Am I capable of becoming like them? Hell no! Not only because I’m not the most talented in STEM, but also because I never have the determination to devote myself to the field of STEM. All the above seems like abstract concepts, what am I gonna do? First, I should quit physics bowl. It is hard to win a prize in the first place, even if I did, the time wasted is too much of a cost and it will make my profile lose focus. Second, I need to treat activities more seriously and totally kill the disguise towards them. </p>
        <p>Now, the following part is for Benny to read this later. Turn this terrible feeling of anxiety, envy, and regret into a “slow” motivation, instead of the “I am gonna stay up all night and study” type of motivation. Try not to get interrupted by other people, hope this blog fills you with determination. </p>

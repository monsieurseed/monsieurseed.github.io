        <h1>Recommender and information cocoon</h1>
        <p>Yesterday from Coursera ML specialization I learned about recommender system. It is an algorithm that first score and then recommend items (e.g., movies, books, music) to users. The recommendations made is, of course, based on the user's past interests. Therefore, the users are more likely to see more of what they liked and see less of what they didn't like. This might lead to a problem known as information cocoon. Acoording to my understanding, not sure what the official one is, information cocoon is a state where you only get to see the mirror image of you past self. Therefore I come up with the idea of designing a recommender system that prevent people from entering the information cocoon. I'm not certain if it is actually helpful though, because with recommender system, both the content creators and the users seem happy. So why me, a nobody, want to mess around with this topic. However, the belief that freedom is usually deprived unconsciously gives me confidence in believing that such thing is indeed beneficial. </p>

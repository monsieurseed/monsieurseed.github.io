        <h1>Tennis and my my grandfather</h1>
        <p>I finally beat my grandfather in tennis. On some points, I even didn’t try hard. As a tennis player, it is ok to say, without much exaggeration, that beating my grandfather has been the ultimate achievement that I strive for. However, the victory today didn’t bring me enjoyment, rather it brought me mild sadness. </p>
        <p>My grandfather is the one who introduced me to tennis. I still remember when I was in elementary school, he and my grandmother, with years (over 10 years if I am not mistaken) of experience in tennis, were great partners. I also heard they played two men and also won significant trophies. During that time, because of my grandfather and the national tennis center right next to my house, I gave up badminton and began to play tennis. 
        </p>
        <p>In my impression, grandfather always hit the puffy green (some people say it’s yellow) ball with ease. He rarely runs. When he needs to move, he walks in a way as if he can predict where the ball is gonna land. He didn’t like to hit the ball hard, rather he did it with a somewhat creepy spin that made his opponents hard to deal with. </p>
        <p>That’s how things went for the past 5 years or so, where he just beats me every time. However, gradually, grandma plays less. They were always playing together, but as years passed, my grandma played less and less and finally, after back surgery stopped playing. </p>
        <p>I didn’t have a firm memory of how I felt when I didn’t see her beside my grandfather on the tennis court not only because I was young, but also because I still saw my grandfather playing. </p>
        <p>But recently, I can’t stop ignoring the fact that the four elderlies in my family were all growing older in some way. My grandmother on my mother’s side began to lose hair, feeling back pain; my grandfather on my father’s side walks slower and slower and spend more time sleeping during the day; my grandmother on my father’s side began to grow more and more white hair. The only elderly that’s not getting old is my grandfather, the one who plays tennis, the one who drinks, the one who walks as fast. At least that’s what I thought. </p>
        <p>Although his moves when playing against me are still seemingly effortless, the heavy breath I heard when we shook hands afterward gave him away. I looked at him, not knowing what to say. 
        </p>
        <p>I thought I could write more because I doubtlessly felt something new and complicated, but for now, I will keep it all to myself. </p>

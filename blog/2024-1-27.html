        <h1>USACO 2024 Jan Bronze</h1>
        <p>It's currently 1:00 am but I have not the slightest sense of sleepiness because I just scored 1000/1000 in USACO 2024 Jan Bronze. To be honest though, this time the contest is much easier than last time. Apart from that, I think it's because this time I can calm down and think by myself. Last but not least, thank you Brian Dean for making this contest easy enough for me to pass. Long live farmer John!</p>

        <h1>USACO 2024 Jan Bronze and HiMCM</h1>
        <p>It's currently 1:00 am but I have not the slightest sense of sleepiness because I just scored 1000/1000 in USACO 2024 Jan Bronze. To be honest though, this time the contest is much easier than last time. Apart from that, I think it's because this time I can calm down and think by myself. Last but not least, thank you Brian Dean for making this contest easy enough for me to pass. Long live farmer John!</p>

        <p>Now my feeling has turned upside down from yesterday because I just found out our team only got a Honorable Mention in HiMCM, which is the second worst prize possible of receiving. Given that we paid more than 30k RMB and the teacher said it will at least get a Merituous mention, we need to argue a little bit. Now I feel grateful that I passed USACO bronze otherwise I will feel more terrbile, although I alrealy is feeling very very dissapointed, to myself and mostly, the teacher. </p>

        <p>I guess I need to turn this dissapointment and anger and sadness into motivation and work harder.</p>

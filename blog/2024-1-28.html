        <h1>Arriving in Changsha, Hunan</h1>
        <p>I just arrived in Changsha, Hunan, where I started doing CP and where my father lives and works. Since arrival, he first asked me to wear all kinds of clothes, then offered me toothbrush and towels. After saying good night for the fourth time or so, he finally went into his own room and left me alone to write this blog. I've had a hard time getting along with my father, but this time I felt something that I never felt with him before. Did he treat me differently? Or it's me who changed? Anyway, I need to go to bed right now. Tomorrow I need to focus on IMMC and learn USACO silver content. Good night~</p>

        <h1>A good idea!? Teach 100… No, 50? Elderlies to use AI?</h1>
        <p>Yesterday after the monthly desperate discussion on the same old topic, activities, my parents and I decided that I should work based on my past research paper on the digital divide and the elderly. AI is added as a new element given my interest in it. So the plan is to train a AI model particularly good at helping elderlies and teach some random old people to use this model. The former is quite easy with the help of Baidu Agent Builder, which I was playing around recently. The latter is what’s challenging. Some questions remain unanswered. </p>
        <p>Q: How many elderlies do I wanna teach?
            <br>
            A: 100 would be great because it sounds nice but it’s a bit unrealistic and maybe I should start with 10.</p>
        <p>Q: I what ways can the project be presented?
            <br>
            A: Website can be a great choice, along with public accounts or even videos.</p>
        <p>Q: What do you want to know from the elderlies?
            <br>
            A: Haven’t decided yet, maybe their occupations, their needs, their age…</p>
        <p>Q: What name should the project have?
            <br>
            A: Haven’t decided. </p>
        <p>Anyway, it’s a good start and I need to convince myself, just do it. </p>

        <h1>Gluttony, I commited</h1>
        <p>Today, to welcome a father's friend, from Changsha, we had lunch and dinner together. For lunch, we had Shandong food. My favorite is Sea urchin and tofu casserole. As for lunch, we had American food in a restaurant that is filled with American elements like Hollywood, football, cartoon... Luckily gluttony is the second from last serious sins out of the seven deadly sins. </p>
        <p>Also, I've been running for the recent days. Although exhausting and desparate at certain points, there is a vague feeling that my mental strength has go up. </p>

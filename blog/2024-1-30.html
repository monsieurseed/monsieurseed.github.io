        <h1>IMMC reflection</h1>
        <p>Just submitted the IMMC paper that we've been working on for the past four days. The topic is about how to distribute 30 goods to 5 people fairly base on their subjective value towards the goods. The goods that are waiting to be distribute are very funny, including antique iPhone 17, automatic chicken counter and many more. But you know what's funnier, us!</p>
        <p>The ultimate task for us is to generate a distribution of goods, we did have a somewhat complicated model and a great visualization that looks like this:</p>
        <img src="../img/distribution.png" alt="distribution" width="500">
        <p>It looks nice, the problem is, we forget to include in the paper which icon represents which item!</p>
        <p>Anyway, what is over is over, for the next few days, I will mainly work on volunteering, computational philosophy, machine learning, and physics. Good luck!</p>
        <h2>My father's weird hobby</h2>
        <p>For some reason, my father pays a lot of attention in taking care of himself and this effort seems to pay off because many guests can't believe or pretent unable to believe that a "young" gentleman like him is capable of having a son that's as "old" as me. He seems to be quite proud about it and said to me, in a low voice, "maybe you should call me 'brother'". I am speechless... </p>

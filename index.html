  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm monsieurseed, a high school student into programming and computational sociology. This personal website is an archive of my blogs, which will (perhaps) cover a wide range of topics, such as computational sociology, my daily life, and other things I'm interested in and want to share with you. </p>
  <p>The reason that this personal website is created is that I want to practice my English writing and to learn web development. </p>
  <p>The following are my blogs: </p>
